# angular-s-services-factory-provider
angular service.factory,provider example with code
this is simple and very explanational example for angularjs service,factory and provider.

the most important thing you can serve this dynamic code using just making the instance of python -m SimpleHTTPServer by just runnin "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" from command prompt ..(you need to install python for that) the python http server will be start on port 8000 by default after running this command
